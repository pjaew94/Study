<!-- Creating EJS Templates
  We're making a template so taht we don't have to create a new HTML page every time we want to direct our pages that are similar to each other. We can also use the rendering to input node/express outputs into our html files.
  Anything you cand do in html, you can do in ejs.
  


   1. npm install ejs
   2. Input 
          app.set('view engine', 'ejs')
            This tells our app to use ejs as its view engine. Make sure to include it below the 
            const app=express()
   3. Create a folder called 'views' on the directory with your code. This is the location where ejs will look for by default to render your files.
   4. Input
          app.get('/', (req, res) => {
            res.render('index', {foo: 'FOO'});
          });
            This tells the app to render the index file while using the ejs engine.  -->
